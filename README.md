This repo contains the code for our Supervised Machine Learning course project called Facify, which is a facial attributes classifier for the  [UTK faces dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/). The CNN folder contains all the training and testing code files used for **Multi-Label Image Classification with Pytorch** (reference: [**Multi-Label Image Classification with Pytorch**](https://www.learnopencv.com/multi-label-image-classification-with-pytorch/)) whereas the **traditional ML methods** are implemented in the folder named Traditional. 

Download the data and put the images inside CNN/UTKFace/images in order to run csv_read.py which creates the csv files used for training and validation sets in all the experiments. The csv files have also been provided here so they can be used directly too.
